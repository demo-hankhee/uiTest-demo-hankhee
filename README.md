I have been in software development field for about 17 years and since 3 years back I am holding the position of a software development manager. I am currently engaging with 3 scrums teams and each with 6 engineers. As a people leader, my role mainly involves in growing my people and leading the team towards company’s direction. Coaching the team on agile values and maintaining good working atmosphere within the team have always been my end goal. As a manager with technical background, I always keep myself up to date in the world of technology as Pluralsight is my favorite learning channel. React.js is the latest technical skill I have picked up while cypress is my latest and favourite automation testing tool. Other than having strong development interest, I believe having good exposure in technology will always prove to be an advantage in speaking engineer language.

I have build a simple `CRUD` project with `#node.js`,`#express.js`,`#mongodb`,`#react.js` to demostrate my coding passion. If you are looking for a manager/leader with good technical knowledge, or a technical person with good management skill, I might be the right person for you.

```
You would be described as extremely competitive, enterprising, assertive, aggressive, tough minded, determined and goal
oriented. You may display new and creative ways to reach your personal and work objectives and you will be selfevaluative
and sometimes critical of your own performance. Given a goal, objective or requirement, you would be able to
develop your own plan, manage your time and focus your effort on a daily basis to reach your goals. Being a self-manager
should come very naturally to you and these skills should be refined through formal training and/or on-the-job experience.
```

##### In Terms of Your Style & Strength of Various Motivations
```
People would see you as being motivated to a very great extent by your sincere concern for the well-being of others. In
addition, they may see you as a person who has the potential to achieve some very meaningful objectives which have the
creation of a good level of personal income as a major factor. To achieve at the level of which you are capable and to
obtain both personal and financial satisfaction, you should set your career goals towards obtaining a position in an
organization whose purpose has real human and/or social merit and where you can occasionally take on challenging
special tasks which are very demanding and which will reward you for their successful completion.
```

##### In Terms of Your Independence vs Your Need to Be in the 'Team'
```
You would be described as quite strong-minded, stubborn, demanding, firm, independent and resolute. You would be
innovative in certain circumstances to achieve your objectives and tend to seek some additional responsibilities in your job
and personal life. You would accept minimal supervision but it would be difficult for a supervisor to guide or closely
supervise you over an extended period of time.
```

##### In Terms of Your Orientation Towards the 'People' Side of Business
```
You would be described as somewhat sociable, enthusiastic, cheerful, lively and entertaining. While valuing social
interactions, you may be somewhat reserved in your initial contacts with new people. The achievement of goals would be
through personal relationships developed over a longer period of time.
```

##### In Terms of Your Orientation Towards Technical & Practical Concerns
```
You would be described as quite logical, reflective, analytical, factual and practical. A job requiring the solving of
intellectual or conceptual problems would stimulate a person such as yourself. You would have a flair for technically
oriented and detailed work. Taking on challenges to learn and use new information in a field that interests you would be
rewarding in itself.
